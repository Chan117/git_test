This will be my very first project using a virtual machine in combination with gitHub. 
Actually, this will be my first coding project, period. 
I am excited to learn and am eager to begin my journey. I will return afterwards and provide an 
update on my experiences. Many thanks to The Odin Project. I hope to contribute back in the future.
